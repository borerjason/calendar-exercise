### Issues Resolved

[CSS] Each time slot event should take up the full width and vertically stack on top of each other. On larger screens, when there are multiple events for a time slot, they should be evenly divided on the same row.   
[CSS] Entire page background needs a gradient from white (top) to light gray (bottom)   
[CSS] Add rounded corners on overall grid, time slot events, and event detail overlay   
[CSS] Event color indicator in overlay (small square next to the time time) should match the event color   
[CSS] Remove double border at bottom of the 11PM timeslot   
[JS/CSS] Past events should display faded out   
[JS/CSS] Prevent scrolling in the background when event detail shows   
[JS] Buttons to navigate to previous/next day do not work   
[JS] Implement filtering by day, so that events only appear on their respective dates   
[JS] Improve naively implemented getDisplayDate helper function   
[JS] Improve naively implemented getDisplayHour helper function   
[JS] Hitting ESC key should close event details overlay   
[JS] Clicking outside of an open event details overlay should close the overlay  
[JS/HTML] Event detail overlay is missing proper ARIA attributes (one lable added for close button)
